# C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

In this project, I learned about what and how to use pointers to pointers
and multidimensional arrays in C as well as the most common C standard library
functions to manipulate strings.

## Helper File :raised_hands:

* [_putchar.c](./_putchar.c): C function that writes a character to `stdout`.

## Header File :file_folder:

* [main.h](./main.h): Header file containing prototypes for all functions written
in the project.
